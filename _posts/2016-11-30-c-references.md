What is "C"? Where is C defined? Unfortunately, several places.

The oldest "official" source is _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Ritchie. There are:

* [The first edition, 1978](https://ia801303.us.archive.org/1/items/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20First%20Edition%20[UA-07].pdf)
* [The second edition, 1988](https://hassanolity.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/the_c_programming_language_2.pdf)

Next there are a bunch of standards referred to by year number: C89, C99, C11. The best source for these seems to be [this site](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/).

Since C seems to emphasize backwards compatibility, you can read them in order. This might make sense, because the older versions are much shorter.
