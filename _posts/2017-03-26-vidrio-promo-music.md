Yesterday I studied the promo video for Framer. The key element of that video is music. If you mute it, it's not _bad_, but with music, it's far more effective.

It's clear that the video was designed around the music, and not the other way around. I browsed royalty-free music and found a piece which I think can work for a draft of Vidrio's promo video. [It's here.](https://vidr.io/soundroll_protest.mp3) I'll design the video around that.

The track is 1:35, but I only want the first 40 seconds ish. I'll fade it out after that time.

The major transitions are at: 10 seconds, 24 seconds, 37 seconds. A few seconds after the 37 second transition, I'll fade out.

This means I want the following sections:

1. 0-10 seconds, intro
2. 10-24 seconds (14 seconds total)
3. 24-37 seconds (13 seconds total)
4. 37+ seconds, outro
