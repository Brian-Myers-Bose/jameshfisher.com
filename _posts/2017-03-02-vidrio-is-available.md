title: "Vidrio is available!"
justification: "I said I would release Vidrio. I did it!"

See [the website](https://vidr.io/) and [the Mac App Store page](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vidrio/id1209843625)! The review process was painless; I received the go-ahead about 8 hours after submitting Vidrio for review. I was expecting an arduous battle, considering the stories I've heard about the App Store review process.

So what's next? There are several things I want to do. Here are the immediate term ones:

* Fix a bug: when switching to a differently-sized screen, e.g. through Airplay, the webcam overlay doesn't resize. I need a second screen to test this!
* Pause/restart. I want to encourage the user to keep Vidrio running all the time.
* Remove the regular Vidrio taskbar. Vidrio should just be a menu bar app.
* Slider on the touch bar! Waiting for my new MacBook Pro at work so I can implement this ...
* An introduction when first launching the app. Nothing tells you what the app is _for_. This can be accessed again via "About" section of the menu.

In the medium term, I want to promote Vidrio:

* An intro/promo video on the website.
* Better slides (not screenshots) in the App Store.
* Promote it on Product Hunt etc.

The longer-term plans:

* Slap a price on it, somehow.
* A Windows version! But I have no experience with Windows ...
* (Experimental, probably silly) Gesture recognition. However, all the webcam gesture recognition examples I've seen are terrible. Perhaps this technology is too immature.
* The Grand Vision: Vidrio for screen sharing ... I've described this plan to friends, but not in public. Maybe in a future post.
