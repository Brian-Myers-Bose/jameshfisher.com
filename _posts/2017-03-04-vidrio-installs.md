* March 1: Vidrio released
* March 1: 4 installs
* March 2: 5 installs
* March 3: 35 installs!

A big jump in installs! What's going on? Word of mouth? Someone mentioned it online somewhere? If the former, I should get exponential growth for a while. If the latter, I should see some mention on Google, but I can't find any.
