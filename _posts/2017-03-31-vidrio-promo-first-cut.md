title: "Vidrio promo video: first cut"

I've made [a promo video for Vidrio](https://youtu.be/b0DP6UhlxeI). It's going on [Vidrio's home page](https://vidr.io). Here's the embed:

<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0DP6UhlxeI" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Other things I'd like to add to this include:

* In the "webcam turning on sequence", it would be cool if the screen came on under the webcam, and we zoomed to that.
* It doesn't even mention Tony Stark _once!_
* Other people using Vidrio. Right now it looks like a one-man band, which it is.
* A sequence showing many screens using Vidrio. I have the vision of one screen forking to become four, to become 16, etc.
