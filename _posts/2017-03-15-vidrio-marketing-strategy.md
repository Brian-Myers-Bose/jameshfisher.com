title: "Vidrio marketing strategy"
justification: "I'm working on Vidrio this month. As well as dev, it needs marketing. What's the strategy?"

Vidrio so far has been a "soft launch". I released it on the Mac App Store, created a website, and told some people at work. To date, I haven't posted links to the site from anywhere. This has resulted in a few hundred downloads, and a grand total of 21 unique users visiting the site. Thus, nearly everyone is discovering the site through the Mac App Store. There's a dribble of around 10 downloads per day. Does not look like exponential growth. So most people find Vidrio by _browsing_ the Mac App Store. They don't find Vidrio by word-of-mouth, or via [the website](https://vidr.io).

At some point I need to change that and drive people to the app from elsewhere. I need to find the right places to promote it. In my bubble, there are:

* [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com/)
* Twitter
* Reddit

I'll curate this list as I think of others.

Before promoting Vidrio, I need to flesh out the website. Currently it really does not say at all what the product is.
