The other day [I submitted Vidrio to /r/macapps](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/6tgk8g/vidrio_a_macos_screencasting_app_i_made_feedback/). At the time of writing, it has 6 measly upvotes, and 110 views. From those 110 views, I have 9 installs on the Mac App Store, and 11 direct downloads. 20 installs from 110 views seems pretty good.

Then [I submitted Vidrio to /r/Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/6txkry/vidrio_a_holographic_screencasting_app_that_i/). It got just 5 upvotes. From here, Vidrio got 146 installs on the Mac App Store, and around 200 direct installs.

This is after a long period of zero or one installs per day on the Mac App Store. 5 upvotes on Reddit can get 350 installs. Marketing works.
