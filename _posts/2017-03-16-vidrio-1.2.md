Vidrio 1.2, released today, is a bugfix. When the screen resolution changes, Vidrio was not changing size with it. The Vidrio implementation absolutely positions an absolutely sized window on the main screen. A CSS-style solution would be just to say `width: 100%; height: 100%;` but Cocoa seems to be lower-level than that. Instead, I'm listening to screen change events, and resizing/repositioning the screen whenever the screens change.

I'm not sure how this behaves when the main screen changes. I'll have to investigate that.
