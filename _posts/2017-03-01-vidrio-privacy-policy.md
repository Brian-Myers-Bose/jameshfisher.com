title: "Vidrio privacy policy"
justification: "I'm releasing Vidrio on the Mac App Store. They want the URL of a 'privacy policy'. I don't know what should be in it."

App Records on iTunes Connect have a field for a privacy policy URL. The review guidelines don't say much about it, though. I started with [this generic privacy policy by Docracy](https://www.docracy.com/6016/mobile-privacy-policy), and edited it to be as short as possible. The result is [https://vidr.io/privacy](https://vidr.io/privacy).
