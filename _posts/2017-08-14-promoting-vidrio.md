title: "Promoting Vidrio"
---

I've got to the point where I want to start promoting Vidrio: it's functional, downloadable, and the marketing material is decent. To promote Vidrio, I'll post it to various online forums. The main two forums I know are [Show Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).

But before that I'd like to post to smaller forums, to iron out any problems they find. I've started by [posting to /r/MacApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/6tgk8g/vidrio_a_macos_screencasting_app_i_made_feedback/).
